File objects can be iterated in the same way as other Python sequences like list or strings.

```python
with open("spider.txt") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.upper())
```

The file has a new line character at the end of each line. So when Python reads the file line by line, the line variable will always have a new line character at the end. In other words, the newline character is not removed when calling read line.
