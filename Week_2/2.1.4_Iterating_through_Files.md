File objects can be iterated in the same way as other Python sequences like list or strings.

```python
with open("spider.txt") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.upper())
```

The file has a new line character at the end of each line. So when Python reads the file line by line, the line variable will always have a new line character at the end. In other words, the newline character is not removed when calling `readline`. When we ask Python to print the line, the print function adds another new line character, creating an empty line. 

Adding `strip()` method will solve the problem.

```python
with open("spider.txt") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip().upper())
```

Read the file lines into a list, then work on a list. Not advisable for large files as it becomes less efficient.

```python
file = open("spider.txt")
lines = file.readlines()
file.close()
lines.sort()
print(lines)
```
