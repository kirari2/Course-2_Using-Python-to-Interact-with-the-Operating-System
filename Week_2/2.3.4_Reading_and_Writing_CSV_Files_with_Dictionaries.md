Create `software.csv`
```python
with open("software.csv", "w") as software_csv:
	writer = csv.writer(software_csv)
	writer.writerow(["name", "version", "status", "users"])
	writer.writerow(["MailTree", "5.34", "production", "324"])
	writer.writerow(["CalDoor", "1.25.1", "beta", "22"])
	writer.writerow(["Chatty Chicken", "0.34", "alpha", "4"])
```

The `DictReader` turns each row of data in a the CSV file into a dictionary
```python
with open("software.csv") as software:
	reader = csv.DictReader(software)
	for row in reader:
		print("{} has {} users".format(row["name"], row["users"]))
```

Create `users` dictionary
```python
users = [{"name": "Sol Mansi", "username": "solm", "department": "IT infrastructure"},
		 {"name": "Lio Nelson", "username": "lion", "department": "User Experience Research"},
		 {"name": "Charlie Grey", "username": "greyc", "department": "Development"}]
keys = ["name", "username", "department"]
```

The `DictWriter` generate a CSV file from the contents of a list of dictionaries, where each element in the list will be a row in the file. The `writeheader()` create the first line of the CSV based on the keys. The `writerows()` will turn the list of dictionaries into lines in that file.

```python
with open("by_department.csv", "w") as by_department:
	writer = csv.DictWriter(by_department, fieldnames = keys)
	writer.writeheader()
	writer.writerows(users)
```
